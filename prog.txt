<p style="font-family:calibri;text-align:center;">In a lush jungle, a mischievous monkey and a cunning turtle crossed paths. The monkey, known for<br>
its cleverness, teased the slow-moving turtle for its sluggishness. Determined to prove its worth,<br> 
the turtle challenged the monkey to a race. Amused, the monkey accepted, confident of winning.</br></p>

<p style="font-family:arialblack;text-align:center;">On race day, the turtle proposed a unique challenge: a race across a river. The monkey, adept at<br>
climbing trees, scoffed at the idea. The turtle, however, suggested carrying the monkey on its <br> 
back. Intrigued, the monkey agreed, thinking it would be an easy victory.</br></p>

<p style="font-family:calibri;text-align:center;">As they reached the middle of the river, the turtle cleverly dove underwater, leaving the monkey<br>
stranded on its back. The turtle emerged at the other side, winning the race. The monkey learned <br> 
a valuable lesson in humility, realizing that quick thinking and adaptability are just as important as<br>
speed.</br></p>
